                <p className="px-3 ">Mechanical Engineers are constantly pushing the boundaries of what is physically possible in order to produce safer, cheaper, and more efficient machines and mechanical systems. Huge opportunities exist for mechanical engineers and they are being employed in nearly every industry. The Department of Mechanical Engineering was established in the year 2007. The department is well poised to shape the students to become highly motivated scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, & policy makers needed to address complex societal issues.</p>
                <ul className="list-style" >
                    <li>The Department offers Under Graduate program in Mechanical Engineering leading to B.E. degree.</li>
                    <li>The Department strives to enhance student interest in advances in mechanical engineering, and impart high quality education through well-qualified & highly motivated faculty team, wellequipped laboratories, and instructional facilities..</li>
                    <li>The Department underscores the importance of recognizing that mechanical engineering education must be coupled with modern industry practices giving hands-on opportunity for every student to relate theory with practice..</li>
                    <li>The Departmentâ€™s all around sound performance in every sphere of academic activity has a well enough proof that it is student focused.</li>
